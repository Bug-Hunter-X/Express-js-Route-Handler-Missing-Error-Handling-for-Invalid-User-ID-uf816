# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling for invalid input.  Specifically, the `/users/:id` route attempts to parse the `id` parameter as an integer but doesn't handle cases where the parameter is not a valid integer, potentially resulting in unexpected behavior or crashes.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to add robust error handling to prevent this.

## Bug
The main issue lies in the lack of error handling around the `parseInt(userId)` call. If the `userId` parameter is not a valid integer, `parseInt` will return `NaN`, leading to the `find` method failing silently, or potentially throwing an error in certain situations.

## Solution
The solution involves adding explicit checks to validate the `userId` parameter before attempting to parse it or use it in the `find` method.  This ensures that only valid input is processed, improving the robustness and reliability of the application.
